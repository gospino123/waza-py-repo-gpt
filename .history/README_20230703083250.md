```

##Overview
This API allows you to interact with the Deal ID service which provides information based on a dataset of 75+ deal feeds. The data is refreshed daily.

##Endpoint

]

##Description:
This script creates a Knowledge Assistant that interacts with the user through the console or REST requests.
- The user can input a URL, and the assistant will fetch the text content from that URL, extract embeddings for similarity matching, and store it for future querying.
- The user can also input questions, and the assistant will find the most similar text chunk from the stored content and generate responses using OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
Libraries Used:
- openai: For interacting with OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
- bs4 (BeautifulSoup): For parsing HTML and extracting text from web pages.
- requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
- scikit-learn: For calculating cosine similarity between embeddings.
- numpy: For numerical operations such as finding argmax.

Features:
- Set Environmental Variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `USER_PROMPT`.
- Function to split text into smaller chunks.
- Function to get embeddings for large texts.
- Function to parse the URL and create a file name.
- Function to get the most similar text chunk.
- Function to generate a response based on the question and embeddings.
- Function to extract and save URLs from HTML content.
- Infinite loop for user interaction.

##Endpoint Testing
###Command Line (using curl)
Use curl command in the terminal or command prompt:

```sh
Copy code
curl "http://localhost:5000/ask?question=What%20are%20the%20latest%20deals%20available?"```

###Web Browser
Enter the URL directly in the address bar of your web browser:

```perl
Copy code
http://localhost:5000/ask?question=What%20are%20the%20latest%20deals%20available?```


- Please make sure the server is running on the correct port before making the request. You can start the server by running the script and entering deal-id up in the console. Additionally, if the port 5000 is already in use, you may need to specify a different port number.
